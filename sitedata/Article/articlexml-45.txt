  <Description>Find out why you should buy these cute lil wobbling...</Description>
  <Text>&lt;h4&gt;
Those of you who have been living under a rock- &lt;a href="//www.indiabobbles.com/blog/history-and-evolution-of-the-bobble-head" target="_blank"&gt;a &lt;b&gt;bobble head&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a tiny doll with over-sized head that wobbles with the slightest of taps. And Why? Why buy a Bobble head Collectible costing a little over the 500 leaf when there's hundreds of gifting platforms and the oh-so-popular e-commerce sites already there to sell hugely discounted gifting stuff that actually makes sense? 
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Really? Is that what you think of collectibility? OK! We give you 10 safe and sound reasons as to why buying the Indian miniatures is a great idea. Le'go: 
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. History in a Doll&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Reasons-to-buy-Indian-Bobble-Heads/History-in-a-Doll.jpg" alt="Dandi March" title="Gandhi Bobble head inspired by Dandi March"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
And what better way to teach your now and future kids about great Indian men and their larger than life actions? Bobbling inspiration per se?
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Coolest Memorabilia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Reasons-to-buy-Indian-Bobble-Heads/Coolest-Bollywood-Memorabilia.jpg" alt="Bollywood Memorabilia" title="Daku Sambhar Bollywood Memorabilia Bobble head"/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Crazy Bollywood hound, can't get over &lt;i&gt;"Jo Dar gaya Samjho Mar Gaya"&lt;/i&gt; even now? Well here's your chance to keep it with you forever. ;) 
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Happy Inspirations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3GihYQIhNUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen title="Mahatma Gandhi Bobble head Video"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Stick'em in your car or keep them at your favorite place in the house and they are forever there (unless you destroy them) to inspire and keep you and every body around upbeat! 
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Crazy Gift Idea for that Crack Pot Friend (Or You May Be) !&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Reasons-to-buy-Indian-Bobble-Heads/Crack-pot-Collector.jpg" alt="Crazy Doga Fan" title="Crazy Doga Fan and Merchandise Collector"/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Love Indian Comics? Or you an action figure fanatic? Or the star-wars-fantasy-lover-sort ? This is the perfect item to take hold of. 
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Fun and Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Reasons-to-buy-Indian-Bobble-Heads/Fun-n-Learn-Kalaam-Saab.jpg" alt="Dr. Kalaam Missile Man of India" title="Missile Man of India Dr. Kalaam Bobble head"/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
 The likeness of excellence personified and the fun of a bobbling head just at the slightest tap. Need I say more?
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. The Quirk-Quality Equilibrium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Reasons-to-buy-Indian-Bobble-Heads/Elegance-Quirk-Bachchan-Bobble.jpg" alt="Bachchan vs Brando" title="Mr. Bachchan has class"/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
You are all about class but do not mind going off-beat. Well, these bobble heads are not only quirky but also very elegant considering the premium quality material they are made off.  PURE COLLECTIBLE STUFF!  
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. East is East&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Gags/Badass.jpg" alt="Badass Villains Gabbar and Joker" title="Yes Who? Gabbar of course!"/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Lets face it, everything (technology, products, lifestyle, mentality, what not?) that comes to us is like a 100 years old for the West. Although &lt;a href="//www.indiabobbles.com/blog/the-bobble-head-and-the-great-indian-head-wobble-connection" target="_blank"&gt;Bobble heads originally belong to us&lt;/a&gt;, they have come to us years after the western countries adopted them. And now that they have, common grabe'm people! You still side &lt;i&gt;Gabbar&lt;/i&gt; right? 
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Well, You're Thoughtful !&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Reasons-to-buy-Indian-Bobble-Heads/Gandhi-vs-Bhagat.jpg" alt="Bhagat Singh Poorna Swaraj" title="Bhagat calling for Porrna Swaraj "/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
That friend of yours gets all aggressive when hearing about the never-ending corruption in India? &lt;i&gt;"In saale netaaon ko to line se khada karke goliyon se uda dena chahiye"&lt;/i&gt; is part of every other &lt;i&gt;"Is desh ka kya hoga"&lt;/i&gt; conversation with him? Well guess what? He is a staunch believer of Bhagat Singh's philosophy of &lt;i&gt;Poorna Swaraj&lt;/i&gt;(Absolute Independence). Now go be a lamb and inspire him with his mini-idol. You thoughtful angel! 
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Plain Indian Start-Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Reasons-to-buy-Indian-Bobble-Heads/Start-Up.jpg" alt="India Bobbles Start-up" title="Random Home Picture of India Bobbles Products"/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
It is you who wants to end corruption in India; it is you who wants her to be as clean as your own house; it is you who thinks its high time she became more than a developing nation; it is only you who is capable of doing it today. And we can do it together. So be with us and support a small Indian start-up so it can continue to do its thing. We promise (in advance) to extend our support when your idea becomes a start-up. 
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. You Have Earned It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Reasons-to-buy-Indian-Bobble-Heads/Kejriwaal-Bobblehead.jpg" alt="Arvind Kejriwaal Bobblehead" title="Arvind Kejriwaal Common Man Bobblehead" class="pull-left"/&gt;
