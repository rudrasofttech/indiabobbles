    For decades foreign &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/280?title=The%20Bobble-headed%20Indian%20and%20other%20Quirky%20baubles;%20Survival%20tips%20for%20the%20Maiden%20Indian%20Trip" title="The Bobble-headed Indian and other Quirky baubles; Survival tips for the Maiden Indian Trip" target="_blank"&gt;travelers in India &lt;/a&gt;have been faced with a vital question that
    no one has been able to explain. No it is not “whether this food will bring a painful
    round of Delhi belly or not “. Nor is it “what do the ridiculously in-comprehensive
    announcements in our platforms and bus stands ever mean”!
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
    For the hapless white folks used to the simple up and down nod of the head meaning
    “yes” and the sideways shake of the head meaning “no”, the one mystery no mystic
    on India seems to be able to answer is the great &lt;b&gt;Indian head wobble&lt;/b&gt;. The
    sideways motion of the head usually coupled with a goofy grin confounds the &lt;i&gt;firangis&lt;/i&gt;
    to no end. What is it that the wobble means? Yes? No? Maybe?
&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    The Indian head wobble has been immortalized in countless blog posts and journals
    by amateur travelers and established travel writers alike, some describing it as
    a vital skill to pick up while in India and others going as far as categorizing
    it in different ways in order to explain which wobble means “yes”, which one signifies
    “no” and which one says “I really like you" ...!
&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    What they should do is remember one iconic item from the great and weird cultural
    melting pot of American consumerism- the bobble head. A small doll with an impossibly
    large head which is prone to furious and completely pointless wobbling at the slightest
    of taps, the bobble head is a popular toy and collectible in the USA where it is
    sold in the likeness of almost every major global celebrity.
&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    From Michael Jackson doing his moon walk to General George Patton wearing his iconic
    four starred helmet, there is a bobble head for almost everyone in the market, including
    the discerning buyer himself, as getting a custom bobble head in your likeness is
    becoming a popular choice.
&lt;/h5&gt;

    &lt;img src="http://www.indiabobbles.com/drive/Blog-Photos/Indian-Head-Wobble/Gandhi-Bobble.jpg"

&lt;h5&gt;
    In the land where the wobbly head of the dolls have been around for centuries in
    the form of the iconic Indian expression designed solely to mess with a foreigner
    who asks a local a question, the bobble head as a toy has been around only as the
    classical &lt;b&gt;Tanjavur doll&lt;/b&gt;(Remember the &lt;i&gt;mitti ka lady &lt;/i&gt;we bought home
    for Diwali? )- the dancing lady whose head and waist rotate in an imitation of classical
    dance moves. Modern bobble heads on the lines of what has been an insanely popular
    toy abroad has been conspicuously absent from the market.
&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.indiabobbles.com/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;India Bobbles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings a new and
    completely &lt;i&gt;desi&lt;/i&gt; range of bobble-heads based on the iconic design combined
    with personalities who have a larger than life presence in the Indian psyche. Starting
    with none other than the Father of the Nation-complete with his &lt;i&gt;lathi&lt;/i&gt;, round
    spectacles and blissful expression. India Bobbles aims to fill the shelf in your
    house, your study corner, your work station or the dashboard of your car with delightful,
    nodding dolls smiling and wobbling with you all the time, confusing every foreigner
    coming your way even more!
